## ‚úçÔ∏è **Reflection**

### What went well:
- Bringing my idea to the real world and implementing many (for me) very complicated functions
- recreating all the pixel art after losing everything (and it still looks good)

### Challenges:
- overestimating my skill and therefore having to cut out many features I planned to incorporate (of course also due to the short time period)
- linking images and everything else correctly. also getting my ideas of functions to actually work
- asking for help and not feeling bad about it, at first I was extremely hesitant to ask for help, but my friends convinced me and it made everything easier

### Lessons Learned:
- do not always choose the "cool" idea over the simple one (You are making your own life harder)
- You still have to challenge yourself, because if not you can not learn from the experience (I am happy that I chose the "cool" but complicated idea)
