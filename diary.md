+ Today I was able to make the background fit the whole screen, Also I was able to colour the canvas with a mockup background.
+ Then i made the Maincharakter/PlayerObject appear and walk around, even though the sprits only works left to right, but he is there and is able to move with wasd,
+ last thing was making the animals appear, and exit but i can only detect the console log not the image

14.01.2025:
+ first i tryed to make the exit object appear but id did not work and then everything broke down, the Maincharakter was gone as well as all animals, had to start again
+ I was able to recover the mainacharacter and the exit ist working but just when a sprite is used :(
+ I started with my pixelart so that I don't get to fustrated

15.01.2025
+ So I tied following in a youtub tutorial an complitly destroyed my code
+ I am back at where i was before
+ now all the objects are on canvas
+ started with the collision function/logic

16.01.2025
+ I fixed the problem with the classes, I was not able to see the objects if I used the animal class so I use the exit class which is shitty because then the reactCollision would not work
+ then after that i tried implementing an inventory but it did not work
+ so I startet with my pixel art, and started doing my own tileset
+ After that Lukas helped me with the inventory and gave me an idea how to do it easier
+ The animals are now teleporting from there original placement to the inventorybar and are not stacking over each other but getting placed next to each other
