+ Today I was able to make the background fit the whole screen, Also I was able to colour the canvas with a mockup background.
+ Then i made the Maincharakter/PlayerObject appear and walk around, even though the sprits only works left to right, but he is there and is able to move with wasd,
+ last thing was making the animals appear, and exit but i can only detect the console log not the image

14.01.2025:
+ first i tryed to make the exit object appear but id did not work and then everything broke down, the Maincharakter was gone as well as all animals, had to start again
+ I was able to recover the mainacharacter and the exit ist working but just when a sprite is used :(
+ I started with my pixelart so that I don't get to fustrated

15.01.2025
+ So I tied following in a youtub tutorial an complitly destroyed my code
+ I am back at where i was before
+ now all the objects are on canvas
+ started with the collision function/logic

16.01.2025
+ I fixed the problem with the classes, I was not able to see the objects if I used the animal class so I use the exit class which is shitty because then the reactCollision would not work
+ then after that i tried implementing an inventory but it did not work
+ so I startet with my pixel art, and started doing my own tileset
+ After that Lukas helped me with the inventory and gave me an idea how to do it easier
+ The animals are now teleporting from there original placement to the inventorybar and are not stacking over each other but getting placed next to each other

+ I sarted to try with the breeding machine logic but i got fustrated and started bug fixing, because sometimes my screen just would load, but i again failed
+ so I descided to continue with my pixel rate, i am still trying to make my own tile set for an easier map/ canvas and boarders
+ i went home early to day because somehow everything I try failed

+ Its the weekend but we are still husteling, i started again with the bug fixing, 
+ 

19.01.2025 doing this from memory for further info look at entire 21.01.2025*
+ actually managed to fix the loading problem and the inventory bug
+ took me only a whole afternoon

20.01.2025 doing this from memory for further info look at entire 21.01.2025*
+ i started implementing my breeding logic, and got he placment down i guess,#
+ then florian helped me and now its working again,
+ still have do do some make up things but I am rather gratful to florian,
+ did some pixel art as well

21.02.2025
+ so I started to try and implement the pokedex logic, i decided to call it animal archive, because copyright I guess
+ i asked lukas for help and he gave me a starting point again, I started implementing and got the consolelog to work but not the actuall pop up
+ Lukas came to my help again and together we figured it out, I just have to do the styling and so on
+ I was feed up with programming again and decided to work on my start screen which turns out was a stupid Idea, because..
+ MY LAPTOP DECIDED TO TURN OF AND NOTHING WAS SAVEDðŸ˜­
+ so thats why my entries in github are from memory and my whole progress in my tileset which was almost finished is gone ðŸ˜­

22.01.2025
+ Yesterday  night I did almost all of my artwork again, and I implemented it but it was a little bit off, so I started fixing it
+ The next thing was implementing the borders, which was a little bit confusing because the canvas wasn't the same size as the array I got from Tiled
+ First I tried to scale the canvas but then I manually ajusted the arrays and now its a perfect fit
+ then I threw myself on to the images of the mixed animals and was able to fix that as well
+ So I started implementing my ending Condition and my end screen
+ at home I did the arte for Startscreen, Endscreen, and the animalsGif
