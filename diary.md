+ Today I was able to make the background fit the whole screen, Also I was able to colour the canvas with a mockup background.
+ Then i made the Maincharakter/PlayerObject appear and walk around, even though the sprits only works left to right, but he is there and is able to move with wasd,
+ last thing was making the animals appear, and exit but i can only detect the console log not the image

+ first i tryed to make the exit object appear but id did not work and then everything broke down, the Maincharakter was gone as well as all animals, had to start again
+ I was able to recover the mainacharacter and the exit ist working but just when a sprite is used :(
+ I started with my pixelart so that I don't get to fustrated
